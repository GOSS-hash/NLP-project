# Spam Link Detection System - SVM Approach
This machine learning project uses URL features to automatically detect whether a web page contains spam. The model developed is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which evaluates the predictive performance on a dataset consisting of various URLs.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features derived from URLs to determine their spamminess:
- Full URL
- Domain name
- Path tokens
- Query parameters

The data undergoes preprocessing which includes parsing URLs, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing terms. The dataset is then vectorized using TF-IDF to prepare for SVM training.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The SVM was trained with the following steps:
- The URLs were preprocessed to split into components.
- Features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.
- An SVM with default parameters was initially trained.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search to optimize the model.

### Results Summary
- The SVM achieved an accuracy of 95%.
- Detailed performance metrics include a precision of 94% for non-spam and 100% for spam, with corresponding recall rates of 100% and 81%.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Run the Python scripts to preprocess data, train the SVM, and evaluate its performance.
- The trained model can be used to predict the spamminess of new URLs.

For more details, see the provided Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## Production Services
To ensure our spam detection system operates seamlessly in a production environment, we leverage the following cloud services and ML operations practices:

### AWS
- **Amazon S3**: Store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
- **AWS Lambda**: Run code in response to data changes in S3 buckets.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Train, tune, and deploy machine learning models.

### Azure
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For large-scale data storage.
- **Azure Functions**: Event-driven compute for data processing.
- **Azure Machine Learning Service**: Build, train, and deploy models.

### GCP
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Durable and scalable object storage.
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless execution of functions in response to cloud events.
- **AI Platform**: End-to-end machine learning model lifecycle management.

### ML Operations
- **Continuous Training**: Implement pipelines to retrain models with new data.
- **Data Validation**: Use services like AWS Data Pipeline or Azure Data Factory for data integrity checks.
- **Model Monitoring**: Track model performance and data drift to maintain accuracy over time.

These services ensure our model stays updated, scalable, and maintainable, with robust ML operations that support continuous improvement.
